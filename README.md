## üìñ Why this tool exists

Most retail investors dollar-cost average into individual stocks or ETFs and wonder:

- **‚ÄúAm I beating the market?‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúDid my timing or stock picks really outperform simply buying the S&P 500?‚Äù**

This app gives you an **apples-to-apples** comparison by:

1. **Computing your money-weighted return (XIRR)** on all your cash flows and final portfolio value  
2. **Computing the S&P 500‚Äôs XIRR** if you had invested the same amounts on each of those dates  
3. **Comparing simple lump-sum CAGRs** for both your portfolio and a single S&P 500 purchase at your first trade date

Use it to validate your decisions, learn from your timing, and see whether active stock-picking truly added value over ‚Äújust buy the index.‚Äù

| Metric                              | Definition                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total cash invested**             | Sum of all negative cash-flows (buy orders)                                                     |
| **Portfolio XIRR**                  | Internal rate of return on your actual cash-flows + final value                                 |
| **S\&P 500 XIRR (same cash-flows)** | XIRR if you had bought the S\&P 500 index on each date you traded, instead of your stocks       |
| **Portfolio CAGR (lump-sum)**       | CAGR treating your entire invested capital as if it went in on the date of your first trade     |
| **S\&P 500 CAGR (lump-sum)**        | CAGR if you had invested that same total into the S\&P 500 on your first trade date and held it |

You can also expand the **‚ÄúShow raw cash-flows‚Äù** panel to inspect each date and amount.

## üîç Key assumptions & disclaimers

1. **Only trades + one final mark-to-market**

   * We ignore dividends, interest, fees, corporate actions, and interim sell orders.
   * All that matters is your buys (negative cash-flows) and the single end-of-period valuation.
   * **Did not consider cash in your account.**

2. **Money-weighted vs. time-weighted returns**

   * **XIRR** is *dollar-weighted*: it reflects your personal timing of contributions.
   * **CAGR (lump-sum)** is *time-weighted*: shows market performance if money were invested all at once.
   * We compute both so you can see how much of your return came from timing vs. overall market movement.

3. **Price alignment**

   * Trades on non-trading days (weekends/holidays) are mapped to the **most recent prior** trading day‚Äôs closing price.

4. **Year-fraction approximation**

   * We divide by 365 days‚Äîtiny rounding errors may occur over very long periods.

5. **No portfolio rebalancing or fees**

   * This is a *performance analysis*, not a full tax or fee calculation.

## üìà Next steps & enhancements

* **Support dividends & corporate actions** to refine XIRR accuracy
* **Handle intermediate sell orders** explicitly, rather than only netting final value
* **Add other benchmarks** (e.g., Nasdaq Composite, MSCI World)
* **Export charts & tables** as PNG/CSV for your own reports
* **Mobile-friendly layout** for on-the-go performance checks
